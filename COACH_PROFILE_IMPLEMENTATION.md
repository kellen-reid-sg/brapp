# Coach Profile Card - Implementation Guide

## ‚úÖ Simple Version (COMPLETED)

### What You Need to Do

1. **Run the SQL in Supabase:**
   - Open Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run the contents of `/scripts/add-coach-profile-fields.sql`
   - This adds 4 new fields to the `profiles` table:
     - `coaching_experience` (text)
     - `licenses` (text)
     - `specialties` (text)
     - `current_club` (text)

2. **Test the Feature:**
   - Click on any drill card to open the drill modal
   - Click on the author name (it's now underlined and clickable)
   - The coach profile card will appear showing:
     - Avatar (first letter of name)
     - Display name
     - Drills posted count
     - Upvotes received count
     - Current club (if added)
     - Coaching licenses (if added)
     - Experience (if added)
     - Specialties (if added)

3. **Add Your Own Profile Info:**
   - You'll need to create a profile settings page later
   - For now, you can manually update via Supabase dashboard:
     - Go to Table Editor ‚Üí profiles
     - Find your user row
     - Edit the new fields with sample data

### How It Works

- **Click author name** in drill modal ‚Üí Opens coach profile modal
- **Two modals** can be open (drill modal + profile modal)
- **Stats calculated** from database (drills posted, upvotes received)
- **Self-reported** credentials (no verification yet)

### Mobile Behavior

- Profile modal appears centered on screen
- Overlays the drill modal (higher z-index)
- Click backdrop or X button to close

## üêõ Known Limitations (Simple Version)

1. **No profile editing UI** - Users must update via Supabase dashboard
2. **No verification** - Anyone can claim any credentials
3. **No sessions count** - Only shows drills posted
4. **No avatar upload** - Just shows first letter
5. **Anonymous drills** - Won't have author_id, profile won't open

These will be addressed in future iterations.
