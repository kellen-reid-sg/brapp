# Mobile Optimization Progress

**Started:** January 31, 2025  
**Goal:** Make The Boot Room fully usable on mobile devices before beta launch

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Mobile Hamburger Navigation (COMPLETED - Jan 31, 2025)

**Problem:** Navigation bar has 5+ links that overflow off-screen on mobile devices.

**Solution Implemented:**
- CSS modules with media queries (most reliable approach)
- Desktop navigation shows for screens ≥640px (tablets, desktops)
- Hamburger menu shows only for screens <640px (phones)
- Full-screen overlay menu at z-index 2000
- All nav links + auth states (Profile, Sign Out / Sign In, Get Started)
- Menu auto-closes on navigation

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `components/Navigation.jsx` - Added mobileOpen state, hamburger button, mobile overlay
- `components/Navigation.module.css` - Media query breakpoints for show/hide

**Technical Details:**
- State: `mobileOpen` 
- CSS media query: `@media (max-width: 639px)` for mobile-only
- `.desktopNav` - visible by default, hidden <640px
- `.mobileHamburger` - hidden by default, visible <640px
- Pure CSS approach avoids Tailwind compilation issues
- Mobile overlay uses fixed positioning with high z-index

**Time Taken:** 1 hour (including multiple approaches)

**Testing:**
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Desktop browser resize works correctly
- ✅ Desktop nav shows ≥640px
- ✅ Hamburger shows <640px
- ✅ Real device testing complete (verified on phone)

### 2. Home Page Mobile Layout (COMPLETED - Jan 31, 2025)

**Problem:** Desktop grid layouts too cramped on mobile; 2-4 column grids don't work on small screens.

**Solution Implemented:**
- CSS modules with horizontal scroll carousels for mobile (<640px)
- Three sections made swipeable:
  1. Select Your Path cards (4 cards)
  2. Feature Highlights (4 cards)
  3. How It Works (3 steps)
- Scroll-snap for smooth card-to-card swiping
- Each card takes 85% width with peek of next card visible
- Stats section changed to single column stack
- Hero section stacked vertically with reduced typography

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `app/Home.module.css` - Media query breakpoints and carousel styles
- `app/page.js` - Applied CSS module classes

**Technical Details:**
- CSS media query: `@media (max-width: 639px)` (consistent with Navigation)
- Horizontal scroll: `overflow-x: auto`, `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory`
- Card sizing: `flex: 0 0 85%`, `scroll-snap-align: start`
- Scrollbar hidden for clean UI
- Hero typography reduced: title 48px → 32-44px, subtitle 18px → 16px
- Stats numbers: 48px → 36px

**Time Taken:** 1 hour

**Mobile Enhancements:**
- ✅ Dots indicator below each carousel (shows progress)
- ✅ **Clickable dots** - tap to jump to any card
- ✅ Active dot highlighted in green with elongated shape
- ✅ Initial scroll hint animation on page load
- ✅ Auto-scrolls slightly right then back to show swipe affordance
- ✅ Staggered hints (path cards → features → steps)
- ✅ Only visible/active on mobile (<640px)

**Bug Fixes:**
- ✅ Fixed border clipping/disappearing on hover (all cards)
- ✅ Removed `overflow: hidden` from card styles (was clipping borders)
- ✅ Replaced `transform: scale(1.02)` with `box-shadow` for hover effect
- ✅ Removed JS hover handlers (onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave)
- ✅ Using CSS `@media (hover: hover)` for proper desktop-only hover
- ✅ Prevents touch events from triggering hover states on mobile

**Testing:**
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Browser resize testing complete
- ✅ Dot tracking working correctly
- ✅ Border hover issue resolved
- ✅ All carousel interactions verified

**Plan:**
