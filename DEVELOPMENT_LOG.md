## üìù Session Notes

### Session: January 30, 2025
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Focus:** Navigation system, public sessions feed, styling consistency

**Key Decisions:**
- Chose Option 2 for sessions feed: `/sessions/browse` as separate page
- Navigation dropdown uses avatar instead of text link
- Settings option added as placeholder (grayed out)
- Session cards match drill cards exactly (except no "Add to Session" button)
- All sort tabs and filters use consistent green theme
- Home page converted to client component for hover effects

**Challenges Resolved:**
- Profiles join in Supabase query (switched to separate fetch)
- Event handlers on server component (added 'use client')
- Consistent styling across all interactive buttons
- Avatar size (settled on 36px)

**Next Session Priority:**
1. Mobile responsive testing
2. Skeleton loaders
3. Database schema for drills enhancement
