## üöÄ Start Here

When you begin your next session, tackle these in order:

### 1. **Mobile Responsive Testing** ‚ö° HIGHEST PRIORITY

The app is feature-complete but NOT mobile-optimized. This is critical for launch.

**Quick Test:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then open Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Toggle device toolbar ‚Üí Test on:
- iPhone 12/13 (390x844)
- iPad (810x1080)
- Galaxy S20 (360x800)

**Issues to look for:**
- [ ] Navigation bar on mobile (does dropdown work on touch?)
- [ ] Profile page layout (should collapse to 1 column)
- [ ] Session builder on mobile
- [ ] Sort tabs and filters (touch targets too small?)
- [ ] Card layouts breaking

**Files to check:**
- `components/Navigation.jsx` - dropdown might need mobile adjustments
- `app/profile/page.jsx` - has responsive CSS at bottom (verify it works)
- `app/drills/page.jsx` - filters might stack weirdly
- `app/sessions/new/page.jsx` - builder might be cramped

---

### 2. **Rename "MY SESSIONS" to "MY LIBRARY"** ‚ö° QUICK WIN

**What to do:**
- [ ] Update navigation link text in `components/Navigation.jsx` (line ~148)
- [ ] Change from "MY SESSIONS" to "MY LIBRARY"
- [ ] Verify it still links to `/sessions`

**Why:** You already renamed it on the home page, just need to update the nav bar.

---

### 3. **Add Skeleton Loaders** üíé POLISH

Replace "Loading..." text with proper skeleton loaders.

**Priority pages:**
- `/drills` - when fetching drill feed
- `/sessions/browse` - when fetching session feed
- `/profile` - when loading profile data

**Approach:**
Create `components/SkeletonLoader.jsx` with pulsing gray rectangles, then replace:
```jsx
{loading ? <div>Loading...</div> : <Content />}
```
with:
```jsx
{loading ? <SkeletonLoader /> : <Content />}
```

---

### 4. **Test Production Build** üîç DEPLOYMENT PREP

Before deploying, make sure it builds without errors:

```bash
npm run build
```

**Expected:** Should complete successfully  
**If errors:** Fix them before moving forward

Common issues:
- Unused variables/imports
- Missing dependencies
- Type errors in production mode

## üìÅ Files You'll Likely Touch Next Session

**For Mobile:**
- `components/Navigation.jsx` - dropdown mobile behavior
- `app/profile/page.jsx` - responsive grid
- `app/drills/page.jsx` - filter layout on mobile
- `app/sessions/browse/page.jsx` - session feed mobile

**For Skeleton Loaders:**
- `components/SkeletonLoader.jsx` - CREATE THIS
- `app/drills/page.jsx` - replace loading state
- `app/sessions/browse/page.jsx` - replace loading state
- `app/profile/page.jsx` - replace loading state

**For MY LIBRARY:**
- `components/Navigation.jsx` - rename link text
- `app/sessions/page.jsx` - add "Favorited Drills" tab

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Test mobile FIRST** - It's easier to fix responsive issues early than after adding more features
2. **Use actual devices** - Chrome DevTools is good but not perfect
3. **Check the console** - Look for any errors we might have missed
4. **Test auth flows on mobile** - Login, signup, logout on small screen
5. **Test touch interactions** - Dropdowns, buttons, tabs all need to work on touch
